#Piotr's code


#While loop (and also For loop) can be used to have a repetition of a procedure in our code


print("How many times to print the symbol?")
x = int(input()) #x=3

#i is a counter - it keeps track of how many times we went through the loop
i = 0

while i < x: #condition for repeating the code - as long as i lower than x 
  print("\u27BD" , i)
  i = i + 1 #new value of the counter is one more than it used to be

print("We left the loop")
